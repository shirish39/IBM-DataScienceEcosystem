In this final assignment, you will:

    Create a Jupyter Notebook

    Insert code and markdown cells

    Share your notebook through GitHub

Instructions
Note - Screenshots

Throughout this lab, you will be prompted to take screenshots and save them on your device. You will need these screenshots to upload them as your submission for peer review at the end of this course. You can use various free screengrabbing tools or your operating system's shortcut keys to do this (for example, Alt+PrintScreen in Windows and Shift+Command+3 for Mac).

  
There are a total of 25 points possible for this final project.

Your grade will be based on the following Exercises:

Exercise 2 - Create a markdown cell with the title of the notebook. (1 pt)

Exercise 3 - Create a markdown cell for an introduction. (1 pt)

Exercise 4 - Create a markdown cell to list data science languages. (3 pts)

Exercise 5 - Create a markdown cell to list data science libraries. (3 pts)

Exercise 6 - Create a markdown cell with a table of Data Science tools. (3 pts)

Exercise 7 - Create a markdown cell introducing arithmetic expression examples. (1 pt)

Exercise 8 - Create a code cell to multiply and add numbers. (2 pts)

Exercise 9 - Create a code cell to convert minutes to hours. (2 pts)

Exercise 10 -Insert a markdown cell to list Objectives. (3 pts)

Exercise 11 - Create a markdown cell to indicate the Authorâ€™s name. (2 pts)

Exercise 12 - Share your notebook through GitHub (3 pts)

Exercise 13 - Take a screenshot of the first page of the notebook. (1 pt)

The main grading criteria will be:

Is the notebook publicly viewable?

Are there, or do there appear to be, at least 8 Markdown cells and 2 code cells? 

Are the criteria for each cell fulfilled, as described in the "Guidelines for Submission"?

You will not be judged on:

Your English language, including spelling or grammatical mistakes.

Assignment Topic:

You will be provided with an empty Jupyterlite notebook which you will launch in the course, to complete this assignment. You will need to include a combination of markdown and code cells. You will likely need to use the Markdown cheat sheet to help you determine the appropriate syntax for your markdown.
